This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental health indicators using survey data. It covers data cleaning, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, statistical testing, and visualizations.

## Objectives

- Investigate the connection between music habits and mental health (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD).
- Analyze how different genres and listening behavior influence emotional well-being.
- Apply statistical tests to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Visualize insights through charts and summaries.

## Dataset Source

This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle - Music and Mental Health Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results).

- Most respondents are aged between 18–25 and listen to music 2–3 hours a day.
- Anxiety and depression are the most strongly correlated mental health scores.
- Statistical tests revealed that:
  - Being an instrumentalist is significantly related to how music is perceived to affect mental health.
  - Music exploration showed no significant impact on anxiety.
- Music's emotional impact varies more by personal perception than just listening habits.
